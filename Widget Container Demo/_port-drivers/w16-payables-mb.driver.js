/* =====================================================================
   w16-payables-mb.driver.js , verification driver for the W16 Accounts
   Payable By Due Date port.

   FIRST-EVER port of this widget, 2026-09-08, onto Jo's oisin-v2-rebuild
   @ 71ca056. Runs the REAL apF block, lifted verbatim out of index.html,
   inside the shared harness's DOM shim, and drives its OWN delegated
   listeners.

   What this driver is built to catch, in the order the Step 4 doc and the
   Step 5 v2 spec rank the risks:
     1. an aggregate that IGNORES THE HORIZON, which would make the KPI, the
        pill, the bands, the table, the cash panel and the popover disagree.
        The Step 4 Filters section calls filtering widget-wide, so a single
        unscoped reader is this widget's most likely defect,
     2. overdue invoices FALLING OUT of a narrowed horizon (they must always
        be included, whatever the horizon),
     3. the horizon SNAP RULE not firing, leaving the card on a band or a
        date that the new horizon emptied,
     4. band subtotals that do not reconcile to the footer total to the cent,
     5. a sort that triggers a FETCH (only a due-filter or horizon change may),
     6. the due-date tiebreak reverting to vendor-alphabetical,
     7. a view switch appearing anywhere (the Final has none),
     8. a row drill-through coming back (Step 4 open item 1 keeps it unbuilt),
     9. any of Jo's 38 own helpers being modified, especially the four whose
        names begin with the same three letters as our prefix.
