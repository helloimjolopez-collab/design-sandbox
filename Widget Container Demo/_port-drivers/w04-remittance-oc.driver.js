/* =====================================================================
   w04-remittance-oc.driver.js , W04 Remittance Pledges, the (OC) widget
   AFTER the 2026-09-10 build-sheet implementation.

   The (OC) widget is now JO'S OWN CODE (kind remittance-oc, prefix remO)
   with exactly one adopted change: the pop-up that opens when an activity
   is clicked. Every assertion is traceable to a row ID in:
     Design Differences (Jo vs Oisin)/
       Final Version Build Sheet - Jo vs OC (per widget, per size).md

     W04-AL-01  pop-up lists PLEDGES, not receipts        (Adopt ours)
     W04-AL-02  ALL pledges, most instalments missed first(Adopt modified)
     W04-AL-03  export in the modal header, scoped        (Adopt ours)
     W04-AL-04  widget = term elapsed, pop-up = instalments(Adopt/New)
     W04-AL-05  summary strip rebuilt to the new basis    (New)
     W04-AL-06  behind note in payments, not days         (New)
     W04-AL-07  five sorts, most-missed default           (Adopt modified)
     W04-EX-01  table row click opens the pledge pop-up   (Adopt ours)
     W04-EX-02  pacing bar opens the SAME pop-up          (Adopt ours)
     W04-DE-01  same modal at Detail, one implementation  (Adopt ours)
     W04-ST-03  ended-term-unpaid gets its own status     (New)
     W04-ST-04  activity term line = range across pledges (New)

   It replaces w04-remittance-mb.driver.js, which asserted our V2 re-port.
