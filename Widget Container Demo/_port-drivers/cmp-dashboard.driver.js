/* =====================================================================
   cmp-dashboard.driver.js , the "Side by side (Jo vs OC)" comparison TAB.

   This is not a widget driver. The tab is a fourth entry in the shell's
   dashboards array holding 103 cards: for each of the fourteen widgets we
   have ported, HER version at Glance / Explore / Detail, OUR version at the
   same three, and one cmpnote-mb note card summarising that widget's section
   of the Jo vs Oisin design-difference doc.

   The real test in here is not the note card. It is that every one of HER
   fourteen widgets still renders at all three sizes from a registry row built
   by this tab, including the seven she deleted from her own dashboard in her
   commit faa6507 (budget, pension, payroll, remittance, ar, insurance,
   deposits). Their render functions are still in the file; nothing but this
   tab exercises them any more.

   Unlike the widget drivers, this one runs the WHOLE shell script rather than
   one extracted block, because contentHTML() and all fourteen of her entry
   functions have to be live at once. It does that on the shared harness:
   loadShell + runBlock + Assert, with one appended export line so the IIFE's
   internals are reachable, and with render() caught because the shim has no
   real #grid to write into.

   Run from this folder:  node cmp-dashboard.driver.js
